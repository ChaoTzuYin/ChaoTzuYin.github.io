                  Most of the existing algorithms of zero-shot classification problem typically rely on the attribute-based semantic relations among categories to achieve classifying the novel categories without observing any of their instances. While the application of zero-shot learning techniques avoids the necessity of collecting training samples for the novel categories, the training of zero-shot classification model still requires annotating the attribute labels for each class (or even instance) in the training dataset, which is actually also expensive. To this end, in this paper we bring up a new problem scenario: ``\textit{Are we able to derive the zero-shot learning for attributes?}'', to further investigate the potential of reducing the cost of attribute annotations. Basically, given a set of detectors/classifiers for the attributes seen/used in the training dataset, we aim to synthesize the detectors of novel attributes in a zero-shot learning manner. Our proposed method, which is the first of its kind to the best of our knowledge, tackles this new research problem via applying the set operations to first decompose the seen attributes into their basic attributes then recombine these basic attributes into the novel ones.
   Extensive experiments are conducted to verify the capacity of our synthesized detectors for accurately capturing the semantics of the novel attributes, showing the superior performance in terms of detection and localization with respect to other baselines approaches. Moreover, with being given only 32 seen attributes on the Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 dataset, our proposed method is able to synthesize other 207 novel attributes, while various zero-shot classification algorithms trained upon the dataset annotated by our synthesized attribute detectors are able to provide the comparable performance with those trained with the groundtruth manual annotations.

              In this paper, we proposed a novel task-consistency learning method that allows training a vacant space detection network (target task) based on the logic consistency with the semantic outcomes from a flow-based motion behavior classifier (source task) in a parking lot. By well designing the reward mechanism upon semantic consistency, we show the possibility to train the target network in a reinforcement learning setting. Compared with conventional supervised detection methods, this work's main contribution is to learn a vacant space detector via semantic consistency rather than supervised labels. The dynamic learning property may make the proposed detector been deployed and updated in different lots easily without heavy human loads. The experiments show that based on the task consistency rewards from the motion behavior classifier, the vacant space detector can be trained successfully.

                  In this paper, we introduce an online-learning method to model the property of an office building. Unlike conventional control methods where the building property is modeled via a simulator or through offline learning, our building model is adaptively updated according to the dynamic response of a real environment. Upon the building model for environment prediction, the proposed action agent can control the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system in a smarter way by scheduling the temperature reference point. To online learn the model and improve the agent, two practical and seldom discussed issues are addressed. The first challenge is data bias where the collected initial training dataset can only partially reveal the statistical mapping between the control input and the environment response. Hence, the trained model may lack generalization. To overcome the data bias issue, a data augmentation method is proposed to embed physical logic in order to train a proper initial model. Next, an online learning process is introduced to update the model generality during the system operation phase. The second practical issue is the constraints on agent exploration for discovering unknown data samples. During the business hours, to comfort employees, a control agent is not allowed to explore the possible controlling space randomly. To balance data collection and control stability, we introduce a hybrid control strategy that considers both the human control rule and the agent action. A confidence score of the agent model is also automatically estimated to determine a suitable control strategy finally. Our experiments have realized in an office building. The results outperform conventional methods and show its superior in terms of control stability.

			<br>
			Lacking training data is a common issue in smart building control. Although our previous work in done in 2018 allows us to start with limited and biased data and fine-tune with online learning, it still takes several weeks to converge. 
			Besides, agents are not reusable in different buildings due to the difference in the environment, or even different sensor types. Our team is devoted to solving these issue in this project.

			<b>Goal:</b> 
			<br>
			To develop a vacant space detection system which can start with low labeling costs, avoid to store the heavy source dataset, and progress through time.
			<br>
			<b>Challenges:</b>
			<br>
			*The system should be source domain data-free.
			<br>
			*The system should be target domain label-free.
			<br>
			<b>Designs:</b>
			<br>
			In order to meet the requirement, instead of transfer learning, we trained a vacant space detection network (target task) based on the logic consistency with the semantic outcomes from an optical-flow-based car motion detector (source task) in a parking lot via reinforcement learning. The key points are summarized as followed:
			<br>
			1. Source domain data-free: At a start, a car motion detection model is trained by the source data, to predict a slot is either in "car in" state, "car out" state, or "no motion" state, given optical flow as the input. Under this setting, the motion detection model is stored for guiding the target task, but not the source dataset with its labels.
			<br>
			2. Target domain label-free: During training the target task (i.e., vacant space detection model for the target parking lot), we defined the reward function based on the logical relation between car motion and parking slot occupancy. In this way, instead of labeling, the car motion detector can assign the reward for the target task to learn.
			<br>
			3. Since the car motion detection model from the source parking lot might be undesirable for samples from the target parking lot, we design a special warm-up trick to adjust the reward function to deal with the noisy rewards.<br>

            <b>Goal:</b> 
			<br>
			To estimate occupancy by real-time sensor values as an indicator for switching smart buildings to different control modes.
			<br>
			<b>Challenges:</b> 
			<br>	
			*To protect the privacy, only non-image-based sensors are available.
			<br>
			*To provide continuous indicator, given real time sensor status, for multiple mode control, with extremely rough and sparse label. (i.e., only samples that are considered to be either "full occupancy" or "no people" are annotated.)
			<br>
			<b>Designs:</b>
			<br>
			1.Inspired by the design of discriminator in WGAN, a neural network is trained, with the gradient penalty for Lipschitz continuity, to project the sensor states into [0,1] space. We force the "full occupancy" samples to be projected as far away as possible from those samples labeled as "no people", while the unlabeled samples should be smoothly distributed between these two labeled groups.
			<br>
			2.Since the labeled samples are rare, we additionally add a first-order gradient constraint loss to guide the prior knowledge about the relationship between environmental factors and occupancy. (For example, The amount of change in the power supply may be positively correlated with the occupancy changes.)

			<br>
			<b>Challenges:</b> 
			<br>	
			*Collecting data for smart building is extremely time consuming. To work in the real world, the system is required starting with limited.
			<br>
			*In many cases, some of the control parameters for equpments in the smart building are never changed. These biased data can not well represent the how actually the control parameters interact with the world.
			<br>
			*In the real-world scenario, the agent should provide acceptable confort quality while exploring in the early stage.
			<br>
			<b>Designs:</b>
			<br>
			To solve this issue, the algorithm is designed to be a dynamic-learning-based model predictive control system. The key designs are summarized as followed:
			<br>
			1. To solve the problem of rare and biased data, a first-order gradient constraint loss is introduced for guiding the model to learn the correct relationship among environment factors. (For example, the change of AC's temperature setpoint should be positively related to the future temperature changes.)
			<br>
			2. To avoid our agent to perform some extreme setpoints in the early stage, we apply a weighted mixup control strategy with a "safe" constant setpoint defined by user. The mix-up weight is dynamically adjusted depend on the model's qulity (i.e., related to predition error of the latest data sample).
